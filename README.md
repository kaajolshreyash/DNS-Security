Security Research and Implementation
DNS Cache Poisoning and DRDoS Attacks
Conducted an in-depth research on various security threats, including:

DNS Cache Poisoning: Explored the techniques used to manipulate DNS cache, allowing attackers to redirect users to fraudulent websites or steal sensitive information.
Distributed-Reflection Denial of Service (DRDoS) Attacks: Investigated the use of TCP SYN flood attacks to overwhelm targeted systems, and the role of DNS in amplifying these attacks.
DNS Hijacking Techniques: Researched methods used to compromise DNS infrastructure, enabling attackers to redirect users to malicious websites or intercept sensitive data.
Random Subdomain Methodologies: Analyzed the use of random subdomains in DNS attacks, including their role in evading detection and mitigation.
Implementation and Testing
Implemented and tested various attack scenarios using:

Ettercap: Utilized this tool to demonstrate DNS cache poisoning attacks and their impact on network security.
Bot-based SYN Flood Attack: Developed a bot-based system to launch SYN flood attacks, highlighting the potential for DRDoS attacks to overwhelm targeted systems.
Mitigation Techniques
Explored and documented various mitigation techniques to counter the studied attacks, including:

Implementing secure DNS practices and protocols (e.g., DNSSEC)
Configuring firewalls and intrusion detection systems to detect and block malicious traffic
Developing incident response plans to quickly respond to DNS-based attacks.

This research aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of DNS-based attacks and their mitigation techniques, helping to improve the security posture of organizations and individuals alike.
